## To build:

    gem install jekyll
    git checkout gh-pages
    jekyll server

## Open questions

### Site general (and visual)

- Do we like salmon pink? :-) [it's easy to change in config.yml]
- Do we want a logo?
- Do we like the present form of the URLs of documents? Given the subject matter it seems important that they are good. Happy to make tham whatever you recommend (that can be expressed in Jekyll).

#### URI-Patterns document

- Is a table the best format for the meat of the document?
- Three FIXMEs that gjh couldn't resolve
- Have attenpted to find a sensible compromise around which comments to include, which to omit. Policy has been to include 'Editors notes' inline but exclude marginal comments from other users. Two inline comments that referred to specific individuals have also been removed on grounds of better safe than sorry.

## Work remaining

- Cross broswer testing

## Possible additions

- Analytics?

Overview

## Introduction

This website is pulished using the *github pages* feature of github.com. Authoring is done using the Markdown markup language, with static HTML files generated automatically on each git commit using the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) generator.

From the Jeykll documentation:

>You can think of Jekyll as a normalish dynamic blog but rather than parsing content, templates, and tags
on each request, Jekyll does this once _beforehand_ and caches the _entire website_ in a folder for serving statically.

Jekll is billed as 'blogging for hackers' - you *write content like you write code* (ie in a text editor, with a git workflow) - and you should be prepared to get your hands dirty. Like any code, mistakes will result in a site which doesn't compile, but because everything's under version control, no harm will be done. Everything is (in the best sense) hackable, and you can work flexibly to whatever extent you wish to personalise your environment.

A key design goal was for the site to be autogenerated by github with no software installation required except git and a text editor, so we **use no Jekyll plugins**. Because we're working with an off-the-shelf product, the opportunities to add custom programmatic behaviour are fewer. (This is adequate for all presently required functionality. If this becomes a limitation in the future, we can move the page-generation step - but not the hosting - away from github and then the plugin world is our oyster).

Nevertheless, some tasks which you may expect to be automated may require a minor amount of manual administration.Specifically, we're using the built in 'categories' functionality for our *topics*, and the built in 'tags' for *audiences*. This is enforced only by convention not by the technology, so care is required to ensure that pages have **exactly one category**. Pages may however have as many tags (=audiences) as you like.

Similarly, there are canonical lists of both categories/topics and tags/audiences but responsibility for ensuring that you don't accidentally create a new category or tag lies with the author... because some day that might be your intention! (In this case, you should also manually create a new subdirectory in either /by_audience (tags) or /topics (categories) with an appropriate index.html. If in doubt, copy an existing one and change the names.)

### How to: get started

There are three paths to contributing to this repository.

#### 1) Quick online content edits

Github offers a simple but useful online editing interface if you want to make small changes or eg work from a mobile device. Simply log in, navigate to the page you

#### 2) Larger offline content authoring

This requires a working installation of Git. Clone the repository, edit your files, commit to the repository.

#### 3) Developer access

If you're doing extended work on the site, it may be more convenient to run a local copy. This requires Ruby 1.9.

- 'gem install jekyll'
- clone or fork the repo
- cd [repo]
- jekyll server
- point your browser at 0.0.0:4000

### How to: add a new article

### Design rationale

### Layouts

New pages you create should will almost always use one of two layouts:

- page (a regular web page)
- publication (a special layout intended for long-format documents, eg reports, white papers etc)

The following layouts should be used only for index pages when creating a new audience or topic:

- index_for_audience
- index_for_topic

The following layouts are unique on the site and should not be used for new pages:

- home
- all_audiences
- all_topics

The following layout is *abstract* and should never be used except as a parent layout:

- theme
